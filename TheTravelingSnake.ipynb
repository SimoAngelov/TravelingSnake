    "## Overview\n",
    "Snake is a mobile game where the player controls a lengthening line, called the snake. The gameplay consists of rectangular grid of blocks, a snake and a food. The basic rules are the following:\n",
    "1. The initial state of the game begins with a snake of length 1 and a food at two location on the board.\n",
    "2. The snake can move in any of four directions: up, down, left, right. It can't move diagonally.\n",
    "3. Once the snake eat's a food it's length increments by one and a new food spawns in unoccupied square on the board.\n",
    "4. The snake wins, if it can collect all the foods on the board.\n",
    "5. It loses, if its head collides with its body or any of the edges of the board.\n",
    "## History\n",
    "Snake is a mobile game designed for the monochrome 6110 Nokia phones$^{[1]}$. It was inspired by games like the arcade Blockage (1976), Bigfoot Bonkers (1977), Worm (1978) and Nibler (1982). The developer behind the game, Taneli Armano, was born in 1965 and had a passion for board games and computer programming. After studying computer science and and mathematics, he joined Nokia's user interface developing group and worked on the development of its first handsets. Taneli's interest in ringtones led him to programme the tones in some of the handsets, creating memorable musical accompaniments. Snake has become a staple in the mobile gaming industry, with many users recalling the tunes it provided$^{[2]}$. "
